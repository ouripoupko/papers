# A Public Web of Trust of Public Identities

> In the world of people's public actions, privacy is not the name of the game, it is instead a well-known single public identity. - Tim Berners-Lee

Following Tim Berners-Lee design issue of [a public identity](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PublicIdentity.html) we are investigating ways, not only for a person to manage and maintain both his private and public credentials, but also to obtain trust over his public identity. Such trust will have many benefits, including:
1. As Berners-Lee suggets, public figures would like to make sure that their public activity is clearly associated with them and no one else.
2. Trust of online identities helps reduce fake identities and their impact on social networks
3. It enables democratinc processes, specifically voting, in a fully decentralized and distributed way based on self sovereigned identities.
