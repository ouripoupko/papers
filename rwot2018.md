# A Public Web of Trust of Public Identities

> In the world of people's public actions, privacy is not the name of the game, it is instead a well-known single public identity. - Tim Berners-Lee

Following Tim Berners-Lee design issue of [a public identity](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PublicIdentity.html) we are investigating ways, not only for a person to manage and maintain both his private and public credentials, but also to obtain trust over his public identity. Such trust will have many benefits, including:
1. As Berners-Lee suggets, public figures would like to make sure that their public activity is clearly associated with them and no one else.
2. At least minimal trusted publicity is required to help reduce fake identities (sybils) and their impact on social networks
3. It enables democratic processes, specifically voting, in a fully decentralized and distributed way based on self sovereigned identities.

## definitions
We start by mathematically define the concepts of a public identity and a public web of trust. Let ![H](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BH%7D) be a set of people and ![A](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D) a set of attributes which are predicates over people. For each ![h in H](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h%5Cin%5Cmathcal%7BH%7D) and ![a in A](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a%5Cin%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D), ![ah is true](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a(h)%3Dtrue) if the predicate ![a](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a) holds for the person ![h](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h).  A ![profile](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cemph%7Bprofile%7D) is a finite set of attributes ![A subset A](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A%5Csubset%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D).

A person ![h in H](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h%5Cin%5Cmathcal%7BH%7D) who created a key-pair ![K_P K_S](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%28K_P%2CK_S%29) is the owner of ![K_P](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?K_P) and ![K_S](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?K_S). A public identity ![p equals K_P and A](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p%3D%28K_P%2CA%29) consists of a public key ![K_P](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?K_P) and a profile ![A](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A) signed with the corresponding private key ![K_S](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?K_S).  ![A](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A) is called the profile of ![p](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p). 

Let ![P](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P) be a set of public identities with profile attributes in ![A](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D).  A trust edge over ![P](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P) is a directed edge ![e from p to p'](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?e%3Dp%5Cxrightarrow%7BT%7Dp%27),  ![T subset A](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?T%5Csubset%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D) and ![p,p' in P](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p%2Cp%27%5Cin%20P). A public web of trust over ![P](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P), also called a trust graph, is a graph ![W is P and E](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?W%3D%28P%2CE%29) with a set of trust edges ![E](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E) over ![P](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P).
